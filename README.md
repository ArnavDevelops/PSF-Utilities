## Commands

Para SF Utilities uses Discord's new [Slash Commands](https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/slash-commands)
feature. 
This means that all commands are available in the Discord UI. 
To use a command, type `/` in the chat and select the command you want to use. 
This also provides an easily navigable list of all commands. 
**TODO:** Complete list of commands
